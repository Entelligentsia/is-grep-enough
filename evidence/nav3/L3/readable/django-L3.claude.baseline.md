## Django WSGI request lifecycle, end to end

### 1. WSGI server calls `WSGIHandler.__call__`
`django/core/handlers/wsgi.py:120`

The WSGI server calls `WSGIHandler` as a callable, passing the standard `(environ, start_response)` pair. Three things happen immediately before anything else:

- `set_script_prefix(get_script_name(environ))` — stores `SCRIPT_NAME` in a thread-local so `reverse()` can prefix URLs correctly.
- `signals.request_started.send(...)` — fires the `request_started` signal (used by, e.g., the database connection opener).
- `request = self.request_class(environ)` — constructs the `WSGIRequest`.

### 2. `WSGIRequest.__init__` builds the request object
`django/core/handlers/wsgi.py:57`

`WSGIRequest` subclasses `HttpRequest`. The constructor does only the cheap work:

- Decodes `PATH_INFO` and `SCRIPT_NAME` from ISO-8859-1 bytes (WSGI spec) back to UTF-8 via `get_path_info` / `get_script_name`.
- Sets `self.path` (full path including script name) and `self.path_info` (the part after the script prefix).
- Copies the whole `environ` dict into `self.META`.
- Sets `self.method`.
- Wraps `wsgi.input` in `LimitedStream` (capped at `CONTENT_LENGTH` bytes) and stores it as `self._stream` — the body is **not** read yet.
- Sets `self.resolver_match = None` (filled later during URL resolution).

`GET`, `COOKIES`, `POST`, and `FILES` are all lazy (`@cached_property` or `property` delegating to `_load_post_and_files`) — none of them parse anything until first access.

### 3. `WSGIHandler.__call__` hands the request to `get_response`
`django/core/handlers/wsgi.py:124` → `django/core/handlers/base.py:138`

```python
response = self.get_response(request)
```

`BaseHandler.get_response` does two things then steps aside:

```python
set_urlconf(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)   # establishes thread-local URL config
response = self._middleware_chain(request)
```

`_middleware_chain` is the outermost callable of the middleware stack, assembled at startup by `load_middleware`.

### 4. The middleware chain (assembled at startup by `load_middleware`)
`django/core/handlers/base.py:27`

`load_middleware` is called once in `WSGIHandler.__init__`. It iterates `settings.MIDDLEWARE` **in reverse** so that the first middleware listed ends up outermost. For each middleware class it:

1. Instantiates it with the next callable in the chain as `get_response`.
2. Side-loads `process_view`, `process_template_response`, and `process_exception` hooks into three separate lists (`_view_middleware`, `_template_response_middleware`, `_exception_middleware`) — these are called explicitly later, not through the chain.
3. Wraps each layer in `convert_exception_to_response` (from `handlers/exception.py`) so that any unhandled exception becomes a proper HTTP error response.

The innermost callable in the chain is `_get_response` (the actual view dispatcher), also wrapped in `convert_exception_to_response`. So the chain looks like:

```
convert(mw1) → convert(mw2) → … → convert(mwN) → convert(_get_response)
```

Each middleware's `__call__` typically calls `self.get_response(request)` to pass control inward.

### 5. `_get_response` — the inner handler
`django/core/handlers/base.py:176`

Once the request has passed through every middleware's pre-processing, it arrives here. This is where URL resolution, view middleware, and view dispatch happen.

### 6. URL resolution — `resolve_request`
`django/core/handlers/base.py:302`

```python
callback, callback_args, callback_kwargs = self.resolve_request(request)
```

`resolve_request` does:

1. Checks if the middleware stack attached a `request.urlconf` attribute (any middleware can override the URL config per-request). If so, uses that; otherwise falls back to the global `ROOT_URLCONF`.
2. Calls `get_resolver(urlconf)` — this returns a **cached** `URLResolver` instance (`@functools.cache` on `_get_cached_resolver` at `resolvers.py:115`), so the URL tree is only parsed once per process.
3. Calls `resolver.resolve(request.path_info)` and stores the result as `request.resolver_match`.

`resolve_request` then returns the `ResolverMatch`, which supports `__getitem__` unpacking into `(func, args, kwargs)`.

### 7. `URLResolver.resolve` — walking the URL tree
`django/urls/resolvers.py:670`

The root resolver's pattern is `r"^/"`. It matches the leading slash off `path_info`, then iterates `self.url_patterns` (the list from the `urlpatterns` variable in the root URLconf — loaded lazily via `urlconf_module` at first access).

For each entry in `url_patterns`, which is either a `URLPattern` (a leaf) or a nested `URLResolver` (an `include()`):

- **`URLPattern.resolve`** (`resolvers.py:471`): runs `self.pattern.match(path)`. For `path()` routes this uses a `RoutePattern` that calls converters on each captured segment; for `re_path()` it uses a `RegexPattern` that applies the compiled regex. On a match it immediately returns a `ResolverMatch(self.callback, args, kwargs, …)`.
- **Nested `URLResolver.resolve`**: recursively strips its own prefix from the path, then repeats the inner loop.

The first match wins. If nothing matches, `Resolver404` propagates up.

The `ResolverMatch` returned carries:
- `func` — the view callable (already imported; stored as `URLPattern.callback` after being resolved via `get_callable` at pattern registration time).
- `args` / `kwargs` — positional and keyword captures from the URL pattern.
- `url_name`, `app_names`, `namespaces`, `route` — for `reverse()` and debugging.

`request.resolver_match` is set to this object.

### 8. View middleware hooks
`django/core/handlers/base.py:186`

Before calling the view, `_get_response` gives each `process_view` hook a chance to intercept:

```python
for middleware_method in self._view_middleware:
    response = middleware_method(request, callback, callback_args, callback_kwargs)
    if response:
        break
```

The `_view_middleware` list is in MIDDLEWARE order (outermost first — they were `insert(0, …)` during `load_middleware`). Any hook returning a non-`None` response short-circuits the view entirely.

### 9. Atomic wrapping and async adaptation
`django/core/handlers/base.py:194`

```python
wrapped_callback = self.make_view_atomic(callback)
```

`make_view_atomic` (`base.py:347`) checks every database alias for `ATOMIC_REQUESTS = True` and wraps the view in `transaction.atomic(using=alias)` if needed. Async views can't use this (raises `RuntimeError`).

If the view is an `async def` function and we're in the sync path, it's additionally wrapped with `async_to_sync` so it runs in its own event loop.

### 10. View invocation
`django/core/handlers/base.py:199`

```python
response = wrapped_callback(request, *callback_args, **callback_kwargs)
```

This is the actual call. The view receives the fully-built `WSGIRequest` object plus whatever positional and keyword arguments the URL pattern captured. From this point on, control belongs to application code.

A few subtleties worth noting:

- **The URL tree is cached globally** (`@functools.cache` on `_get_cached_resolver`), so the import and compilation of all URL patterns happens once per process, not per request.
- **`path_info` vs `path`**: resolution uses `request.path_info` (the part after `SCRIPT_NAME`), not `request.path`, so that mounted sub-apps work correctly under a URL prefix.
- **`process_view` is separate from the middleware chain**: regular middleware `__call__` wraps the whole response; `process_view` runs only after URL resolution and only before view dispatch, giving it access to the resolved callback and its arguments.
- **Exception handling is layered**: `convert_exception_to_response` wraps every link in the chain, but `process_exception` hooks (in `_exception_middleware`) are called explicitly inside `_get_response` before the exception propagates outward.
